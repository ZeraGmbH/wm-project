All other Windows can be opend and close in the view menu
</p>
<p>
<b>Error values</b>
The error value indication shows the current load point, the error and error angle. The window can be zoomed. 
You can open the context menu with double click and configure
this indication. Field length, resolution and several units can be selected for every single indicated value. The
measuring bridge determines the errors according to IEC and ANSI. Which value will be indicated, can also be set
in the context menu. According to ANSI the angle will be indicated “inactive”.
* The load point can be indicated relatively to the total RMS value of the N-channel or to the RMS value of the fundamental wave.
</p>
<p>
<b>Vectors</b>
The vector indication shows the „raw“ vectors of the primary side of the transformer under test. These „raw”
vectors are the amplitudes of the fundamental wave and phase angle relatively to the sampling window. The
values of the current measuring period will be indicated. The context menu opens by using the right mouse
button in the vector menu. In this window you can select the amplitude resp. the RMS value of the vector and
configure the angle indication in the mathematical resp. technical positive direction of rotation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Inherent error</b>
The inherent error indication shows which inherent error tables are loaded and which ratio is set currently. If the
“inherent error correction” is activated and valid correction data exist the currently used correction values are
shown as “amount” and “angle”.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dialog</b>
The indication of the dialog between the WM3000 application and the servers working in the background should
be deactivated basically due to tying up resources. The dialog should only be used in case of trouble shooting
between client and server.
