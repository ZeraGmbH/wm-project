<b>Signal frequency</b><br/>
The signal frequency defines the nominal frequency of the test values. The real frequency of the test values may
differ up to Â±1%. The sampling frequency of the measuring device is the product of configured nominal frequency
and sample rate. Therefore a nominal frequency of 50 Hz and 80 samples/period equals 4000 Hz scanning
frequency.
</p>
<p>
<b>Measuring interval</b><br/>
You can define how many signal periods are summarized in a measuring period.
Example: You have selected 256 samples/period and 16 periods as measuring interval <br/>
16 x 256 = 4096 samples will be recorded and analyzed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Samples</b><br/>
You can select between 80 und 256 samples per period. These are the basically used values of the merging unit.
</p>
<p>
<b>Integration time</b><br/>
All measuring periods will be processed and filtered successively until the integration time is passed by. If a
measuring period has not been finished until this moment data will not be considered and will be processed in
the next integration period.
