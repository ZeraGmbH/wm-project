Select the menu Edit and a window will open, where you can select an
existing table for further editing. If a table has already been opened, the
menu automatically opens this table and you can edit this table. If you
want to create a new table and no table has been opened before, a window
will open where you can select the location and the file name. The default
name is transformer.oet, change the name as it is required and click to
Save. An example file with predetermined data will open. Data can be
edited as required. If you close the window, though you have not saved it
before, a window will open automatically, where you are requested to
save the file. Enter a new file name or save the data as before.

<b>Reference transformer error</b>
Reference transformer errors are stored in the system and include known error values of used standard
transformers. You can find a description of the file structure in the annex. While opening a reference transformer
error the measuring bridge analyses all its entries and generates corrective curves for every transformer ratio,
which has been found, by interpolating linearly between the detected correction marks. The detected correction
values are used for compensation, if it is activated before in the configuration menu. Currently used correction
values can be visualized in the inherent error indicator.

<b>Measuring results</b>
Measuring results can be stored in result data files. This can be activated by using function key F5 or via main
menu “Store measuring values”. Open a result data file for activation. Results will be stored as XML data files.
Please see annex for further information about the data file.
