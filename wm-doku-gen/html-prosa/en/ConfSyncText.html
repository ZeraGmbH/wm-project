<p>
Synchronization of scanning can be performed via internally generated signal or externally. In this context
synchronization means reset of the scanning system and new recording of all samples for the measuring period.
The internally generated sync signal can be adjusted with a resolution of 100 ms between 0,5 and 2,5 s. The
signal is available at the sync outputs. Additionally external sync signals are available at the free outputs.
Furthermore an output with a 1000 times higher frequency than the sync signal exists.
</p>
<p><b>
Strict synchronization</b> means, that the measuring system controls synchronization of data via connected merging
unit and no “valid” measuring period will be performed if the samples are not equal to this measuring period. The
system runs into timeout which leads to a malfunction message.
Detailed: After a PPS pulse numbering of samples should be start with 0. If a measuring period of 16 signal
periods with 80 samples is set (= 1280 samples), samples with number 0 ... 1279 belongs to the first measuring
period, the samples 1280 ... 2559 to the second and so on.
Deviations from this will be interpreted as malfunction which leads to timeout.
